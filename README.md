#### Named after `Glorious Scarab`
* Latin name: Chrysina gloriosa
* Habitat: Can be found in much of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico
* Size: About 0.98″ to 1.1″ long
* Colorful feature: It might seem strange to call a beetle “glorious,” but this one’s beautiful coloration justifies the name! Almost its entire body is covered in glossy, enamel-like green. It’s also marked with vertical stripes that are usually black or tan.
